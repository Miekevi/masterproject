Creating a dictionary-based NER to use in combination with a frame extractor, in order to extract diseases and genes from text. The taggers can be found in Tagger.py. 
SciBert was used for the LLM version of extracting diseases and genes from text, this can be found in LLMSciBert.ipbynb

In the folder Data, all the training and test data can be found including the data dor the dictionaries. The gene2go file was to large to commit through git. However they can be found through https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/
