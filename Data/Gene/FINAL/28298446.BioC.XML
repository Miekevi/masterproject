Previous studies have suggested that pre-existing disulfide links are absolutely required to allow protein folding and, conversely, that protein folding occurs prior to disulfide formation. To address the question of what happens first within the ER, that is, protein folding or disulfide formation, we studied folding events at the early stages of polypeptide chain translocation into the mammalian ER using stalled translation intermediates. Our results demonstrate that polypeptide folding can occur without complete domain translocation. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) interacts with these early intermediates, but disulfide formation does not occur unless the entire sequence of the protein domain is translocated. This is the first evidence that folding of the polypeptide chain precedes disulfide formation within a cellular context and highlights key differences between protein folding in the ER and refolding of purified proteins.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="code">333</infon><infon key="NCBI Gene identifier">2923</infon><infon key="type">Gene</infon><location offset="779" length="27"/><text>Protein disulfide isomerase</text></annotation><annotation id="1"><infon key="code">333</infon><infon key="NCBI Gene identifier">2923</infon><infon key="type">Gene</infon><location offset="808" length="3"/><text>PDI</text></annotation></passage></document>
